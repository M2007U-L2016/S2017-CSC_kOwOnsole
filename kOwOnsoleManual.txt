---- ---- ---- ---- Console Commands



kon:chunk <word1> <word2> <word3>

    identifies the line you have entered into chunks and prints them,
    mostly useless



kon:clean

    clears the console screen



kon:close

    closes kOwOnsole and go back to your normal console



---- ---- ---- ---- Directory Commands



dir:goto <directoryName>

    changes your current directory to the given directory
    if the directory cannot be found, your current directory will stay the same

    EG: say your current path is "D:/users/Nom", 
    and inside that directory you have a folder called "Deskbottom",
    then typing "dir:goto Deskbottom" 
    this will change your directory from 
    "D:/users/Nom" to "D:/users/Nom/Deskbottom"



dir:goto <directoryName>/.../<directoryName>

    changes your current directory segment by segment to the given directory.
    if a segment of the given path cannot be found, 
    that segment will be ignored, and your current directory path will stay the same.

    in a directory chain, "." will cause nothing to happen,
    and ".." will move you from your current directory to the directory which is one layer above 

    EG : "dir:goto Deskbottom/Fork01/Fork02/Fork03/../Apple" means the following:
    if you can find "Deskbottom", then go in there, else, do nothing;
    if you can find "Fork01", then go in there, else, do nothing;
    if you can find "Fork02", then go in there, else, do nothing;
    if you can find "Fork03", then go in there, else, do nothing;
    if you can go one layer up, then go in there, else, do nothing;
    if you can find "Apple", then go in there, else, do nothing;



dir:make <folderName>

    creates a folder with the name <folderName> in the current directory



dir:list <[Optional] searchString>

    if no search string given, kOwOnsole will list all the files in the current directory you are in.
    if a search string is given, then kOwOnsole will list all the files such that their name contains the given search string.

    EG: say in the directory we have the following files:
    data001.txt
    data002.txt
    data003.txt
    data004.txt
    flower.png
    when we entered "dir:list data",
    "data001.txt", "data002.txt", "data003.txt", "data004.txt" will be listed because these names contain the given string "data"
    in this case, "flower.png" will not be listed because the given string "data" cannot be found in its name.



dir:peek <relative directory> <[Optional] search string>

    a modified version of "dir:list".
    this command is the combination of the following commands:
        - goto a folder (dir:goto)
        - list what is in that folder (dir:list)
        - then come back (dir:goto)

    with this, when we want to "peek" at the concents of a folder, 
    we don't need to go inside the folder and list them, 
    we just need to peek them as long as we know the relative address



dir:where

    prints the absolute path of your current directory.



---- ---- ---- ---- File Commands



file:make <fileName>

    if there is no file in the current directory with the file name <fileName>.
    kOwOnsole will make a file in that directory with that fileName.

    EG: file:make apple.dat



file:copy <source file name / relative source file path> <destination file name / destination file path>

    copies a file from the given source file into a destination directory or a destination file
    if the destination already has other file that has the same name as the destination file,
    kOwOnsole will prompt the user to : cancel copy / change the destination file name / overwritting the exsisting file.

    EG: file:copy folder1024/AppleKofi.txt folder2048



file:print <relative file path> <[Optional] printing mode> <[Optional] spacing string>

    prints a file onto the screen.
    if <[Optional] printing mode> is left empty, then the file will be printed in normal strings, human readable stuff (unless you have non-human-readable stuff inside)
    if <[Optional] printing mode> is "ascii::dec", then each charracter in the file will be printed as ascii numbers (base10)
    if <[Optional] printing mode> is "ascii::hex", then each charrecter will be printed as Base16 ascii numbers

    for both "ascii::dec" and "ascii::hex", if <[Optional] spacing string> is left empty,
    kOwOnsole will ask how many spaces you want in your space string.





---- ---- ---- ---- Tool Commands





tool:rand <iteration> <Num0> <Num1>

    a random number generator,
    a list of random number picked between <Num0> and <Num1> will be printed

    EG: having "kon::toy rand 10 1 50" will give you 10 random integers between 1 and 50



tool:dice <dice list>

    a dice simulator, useful for DnD campaigns.
    a dice list is a list of interger separated by commas
    such that every integer represents the highest number of a dice can roll

    EG : having "kon::toy dice 6,10,10,20,20,20 ", 
    kOwOnsole will roll a D6, 2 D10s and 3 D20s.



tool:calc <"+" xor "*"> <number list>

    a mini calculator to calculate the sum or product of the given number list

    EG : having "tool:calc + 1,2,3,4", kOwOnsole will return with 10, which is 1+2+3+4
    EG : habing "tool:calc * 1,2,3,4", kOwOnsole will return with 24, which is 1*2*3*4



tool: calc <Num0> <"-" xor "/" xor "^" xor "rt" xor "!"> <Num1>

    based on different symbols, kOwOnsole will return different answers.
    "-"  : Num0 - Num1
    "/"  : Num0 / Num1
    "^"  : Num0 ^ Num1
    "rt" : (Num0)root of Num1
    "!"  : Num0 !

    EG: 
    "tool:calc 8 - 4"   : 8 minus 4, 4
    "tool:calc 8 / 4"   : 8 divided by 4, 2
    "tool:calc 2 ^ 3"   : 2 to the power of 3, 8
    "tool:calc 3 rt 27" : cube(3) root of 27, 3
    "tool:calc 5 !"     : 5 factorial, 120
